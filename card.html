<h2>To Karen</h2>
<p>Happy Birthday! Sorry I haven't talked much! The deadline came much faster
	than I expected, so I decided to just full focus rush the whole thing. Sorry if I worried you!
	<br><br>
	So, you're 18 now, huh? That's hella cool. You're pretty old now, and so am I. I've known you since
	Y5, truly got to be your friend in Y7. That all began what, eight years ago now? Who knew, the girl I shook hands
	with before exams in some school would become one of the greatest people I've ever met? Now, we're even
	in different parts of the world. That's insane, to think of how far life has gone.
	<br><br>
	To be honest, when I went through "that" phase in Y9, I made things incredibly weird, so it wasn't much of a surprise
	that I was turned down. Looking back, it definitely would have been strange if you accepted. Now I've seen what
	the real world is like, and how people treat you, I'm glad you weren't too indifferent.

	You were the one who introduced me to anime, and that was one saving grace. I've been able to delve into that colorful, wonderful world.
	Fun fact, I would've probably been way different without that. Even if it was something irrelavant to you, it did shape my life, espeically after highschool.
	Without it, I wouldn't be interested in making new cosplay friends, and kept to myself more. I would've slowed down on piano much more, 
	as RADWIMPS was what inspired me to play, which I got from Denzel, which I wouldn't have gotten without you recommending Your Name.
	<br>
	<br>
	You've been an amazing impact in my life. Without you, I don't know what path I would have followed. Maybe down a darker one (or a brighter one ehe).
	Although you may be pretty far physically, I know you got my back mentally. I really hope that you spent your birthday with some good people over there!
	Don't go Y5 Karen on them!

	Lastly, I'm sure you're aware of this, but the song I sang during graduation was dedicated to all my friends, and you are no exception.
	Every single lyrics apply to everyone, you included. Kawarainaimono, meaning "The Things that Never Change". To be honest, I don't really want to keep going.
	It's incredibly tiring doing all this work, and moving forward is simply exhausting. I don't want to keep going the way I am, not doing anything anywhere.
	Yet, that's the situation. If I could, I would be back to middle school, playing around, and when the checkpoint exams were the things I had to worry about the most.
	Learning new things the same way I did with A-Level maths is soul crushing, but I think I'll be alright. After all, I can't let you come back to
	the same Drew you said bye to, right?
	<br><br>
	Although I wish things really never changed, it all happened, and the future is still coming. Time waits for no one. 
	I hope you had a wonderful celebration, and everyone wished you on that day. Have a great year, future Valedictorian.
	I know you can do it.
